### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyQt5 for the graphical interface
- Paramiko for SFTP support (will be installed if missing, but ensure network access for pip)

### Setup
1. Clone or download the application files.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5 paramiko
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python flashfxp_gui.py
   ```
   (Note: Previously `flashfxp_integrated.py`, now typically `flashfxp_gui.py` if it's the main GUI entry point)

### This isn't fully functional
This was a project to try and clone my favorite FTP client "FlashFXP" since my lifetime license key doesn't work anymore.
